Even despite his small size and old age, Yoda was extremely powerful and accomplished in the Force.
With a connection to that power and knowledge of Force techniques that may well have surpassed that of any other Jedi.
Obi-Wan Kenobi considered Yoda to be the most powerful Jedi he ever knew.
The Grandmaster was heralded as the greatest Jedi of all time, at least until the fall of the Republic.
Yoda was utterly committed to the light side, but he also had a deep understanding of the dark side as well as how both halves of the Force interacted.
The idea he was the greatest of the Jedi went back centuries, at being held least to 232 BBY.
The toll age took on Yoda's body did not prevent him from still being strong in the Force when Luke Skywalker trained under him.
Even in death, as a Force spirit, he had power over weather.

Yoda was extremely skilled in telekinesis and all forms of it.
When Avar Kriss worked with the other Jedi to shove a sun-bursting explosive Avar Kriss found his level of power (which he lent via her Force Song) to be very grand, helpful, and impressive.
When on a mission to free a child, Yoda gripped two pirates who were holding the child and held them helpless, before making them punch each other and then threw them into the air.
Then Yoda defeated the rest of the pirates in the room when they attacked him.
Yoda used Force deflection against a Blue stone spear thrown at him by a member of the Mud dwellers, though holding the spear with the Force was hard for Yoda.
Yoda then levitated many boulders and rocks to catch the rest of the spears thrown at him and kept the rocks levitated for a whole conversation.
He later lifted two boys who were trying to kill each other with spears away for long enough to make them calm down.
Yoda was unable to repel many of the Blue stones that were thrown at him with the Force by the Rockhawkers, due to how hard it was to affect with telekinesis and his unwillingness to harm the children he faced.
Later, and having mastered Stonepower, Yoda was able to casually blast the Rockhawkers who attacked him, subduing and disarming them without inflicting lasting harm.

When facing Dooku on the planet Geonosis, Yoda demonstrated his superior telekinetic mastery by effortlessly repelling every metal piece and stone slab thrown by the very skilled Sith Lord.
During a confrontation with Confederate forces on the coral moon of Rugosa, Yoda effortlessly pulled two droids to slash them with his lightsaber, flung multiple pieces of the droid controlling one of the infantry high into the air and both opened the upper parts of another infantry tank, then sent it and the droid controlling it into the air.
It was with ease that Yoda raised and moved droids to fire upon their allies and slammed whole squads of droids down, without harming his own allies.
After the droids were dealt with, Yoda easily overpowered the powerful Sith Assassin Asajj Ventress with telekinesis, stopping her lightsaber strike mid-way and disarming her with a simple gesture, and repulsed the many stones caused by Ventress activating an explosion.
If Yoda had no desire to touch the ground, he could simply float in a mediative state.

Force barriers were a tool in Yoda's skill set, as seen when he stopped a cloud of deadly gas.
Yoda could strike down his foes by hurling his saber at them, guiding the blow with his telekinetic skills.
When he went to try to destroy the Sith Emperor, Yoda effortlessly defeated two Red Guards by knocking them into a wall.
He was even able to breach the Emperor's defenses and blast Darth Sidious himself through the air with a Force push and was able to stop and throw a Senate hoverpod Sidious had thrown at him when they fought in the Senate building, an all the more impressive feat since it was thrown upwards against gravity.
Later, on Dagobah, Yoda used the Force to throw a pot at an Imperial Probe Droid, destroying it.
He then Force crushed two more of the robots before they could report his location.
In order to teach Luke Skywalker that anything was possible with the Force, Yoda levitated his student's sunken T-65B X-wing starfighter out of a swamp of Dagobah and onto dry land with no visible strain.

With just a few days of training, Yoda was able to learn how to use Stonepower and thus deflect Blue stones thrown at him.
Yoda could move a chunk three times his size--something unknown to his master, though Yoda was then exhausted by doing so.
Yoda could also use Stonepower to stop strikes from giants of living stone, and with the aid of those he taught, call forth other giants to defeat the one he was fighting.
Yoda was capable of employing the power of Force lightning, to the point that he could make several arcs of energy lance out in different directions from only a single finger.
Yoda could manipulate flames with the Force.

Jedi Padawan Bell Zettifar pondered whether Yoda, after putting great focus into the effort, could use the Force to stop gravity.
In his duel with both Sith Lords Count Dooku and Darth Sidious, Yoda displayed great proficiency in Force Deflection, as he was able to easily stop and then redirect Dooku's Force lightning attack with his bare hands and even managed to stop Sidious' Force lightning attack using just his palms but was unable to deflect it completely: the energy eventually exploded and flung both of the combatants away from each other, ending the duel in a stalemate and causing Yoda to escape.
Yoda could dampen or even negate the might of Force powers used to attack him by radiating a calming aura.
Yoda could employ the Force to absorb blaster fire and negate the strikes of lightsabers with his bare hands and channel the energy from blasters or lightning he absorbed into making his own attacks such as Force push and Force lightning more deadly.

His ability to use the combative applications of the Force notwithstanding, Yoda's incredibly strong connection to the Force combined with his years of extensive study also granted him numerous supplementary abilities.
Yoda could enhance himself and seek out objects or persons he knew about regardless of the distance, and easily see though and/or destroy many Force illusions at once.
During the trial of Quinlan Vos, Yoda revealed that he could uncover the alignment of a Force-user just by touching them; stating that the Force had permitted him to read the history of a soul, able to easily sense that he had fallen to the Dark Side despite Vos being proficient enough to hide it from many other Jedi.
Yoda could detect the lies, emotional states, and thoughts of those he interacted with.

While physically isolated on Dagobah, Yoda was able to see other Jedi that were active in the Force; he could not see one that had forsaken the ways of the Jedi, with the exception of Vader who was still exposed to his monitoring.
Yoda could detect living things and droids with the Force and while on Dagobah he could sense all droids on the entire planet or the lack thereof.
He could keep in mental contact with the Jedi Temples across the galaxy, and telepathically converse with any Jedi–even to the point of manipulating the experience to his desires–within them by accessing the World Between Worlds.
Yoda, still on Dagobah, was able to conjure an illusion of the Grand Inquisitor (from when he was a Jedi) to fight Kanan Jarrus as a test and sight of worthiness.
He also sensed that the place where Ezra Bridger and Kanan Jarrus could be assured of a chance to fight the Sith was Malachor, and so told Ezra.
When the Lothal Jedi Temple was invaded, Yoda sent illusions of Jedi Temple Guards at the Inquisitors, subduing them for long enough for the living Jedi present to flee.

With some effort, Yoda could make himself and the powers he invoked impossible to detect with the Force and go unnoticed by most.
When two Blue stone spears were struck together, Yoda sensed the disturbance this caused.
He also sensed the killings that took place during Order 66, the shock of which literarily staggered him, so forewarned by the Force, Yoda was able to destroy the Clones soon sent to slay him on behalf of the Sith.
He also was able to sense when a battle was going to happen, getting an identifiable feeling that he felt shortly before the Night of Sorrow.
Yoda could use the Force to see even in total darkness or when blinded.
Additionally, Yoda was able to use Force healing, even to the extent of healing himself and those around him while in battle with just a wave of his hand.
Yoda was also shown to be capable of experiencing Force visions and could invoke such insights at will for information up to three days into his personal future.
However, he understood that Force prophecy was not absolute and that the future was always in motion.
The Grandmaster could make great leaps with the Force, to maneuver and dodge and charge.
His visions led him to foresee the possible, and eventually actual, fall of the Jedi in the Clone Wars and even his own death.
Yoda sometimes knew if he was probably going to die in a battle he fought in and could augment his physical abilities.

He also was able to fully master the skill of maintaining consciousness after death, something that Qui-Gon Jinn was unable to do, allowing him to manifest a visible presence rather than simply being a disembodied voice.
As a Force spirit, Yoda was capable of manipulating weather to create lightning strikes.
He was also shown to be capable of striking Luke Skywalker with his walking stick, demonstrating an ability to interact with the living world in a physical sense despite both Yoda and the stick being ostensibly non-corporeal.
