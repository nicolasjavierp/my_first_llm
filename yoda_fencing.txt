Despite his small size and old age, Yoda was an extremely accomplished lightsaber duelist, wielding a short green-bladed lightsaber.
Yoda used the Ataru saber form, boosting his body with the Force to be able to perform the needed movements.
Such was his mastery of this form that Yoda could duel Sidious and almost defeated the Sith.
Yoda was a master of the Niman style of lightsaber combat, retaining his skills with the form for his whole life.


Yoda was extremely skilled in blast-deflection and proved more than capable of taking on multiple enemies at the same time and winning easily: he was able to single-handedly defeat without getting even a single shot to his person an entire army of droids that Ventress sent as a test for King Katunko whether to accept the Jedi or the Separatists as an ally.


The greatest display of Yoda's skills with a lightsaber was when he dueled the Sith Lords Count Dooku and Darth Sidious.
When he fought Dooku, Yoda maintained the upper hand through the duel, forcing Dooku into the defensive, and would have defeated him had he not decided to flee.
His duel with Sidious, although initially well-matched, eventually began to turn into Yoda's favor, forcing Sidious to use the Force to confront him.
